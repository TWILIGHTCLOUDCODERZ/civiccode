## Inspiration:-
&emsp;&emsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI) reshapes companies and how innovation management is organized. Consistent with rapid technological development and the replacement of human organization, AI may indeed compel management to rethink a company's entire innovation process.

&emsp;&emsp;In our project we are providing solution solution for three problems which faced by major healthcare industry.

## Tools Used:-
<p> Azure cloud services and other connector and technology tools.</p>

## Test Our Live APP:-

<li>**Webview:-**</li>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The site has been hosted in azure web app services which shows keen view of data analytics and AI bot features [WebviewLink](https://civiccodehackathon.azurewebsites.net/).

<li>**Github:-**</li>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The site has been hosted in Github which includes project repository-[WebviewLink](https://github.com/TWILIGHTCLOUDCODERZ/civiccode.git).

&emsp;&emsp;PowerBi data Visualization which shows keen view of medicare charge according to country and provider wise  [WebviewLink](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzk0NTVmYjYtYjNmMS00MTljLWI3NDktZDliNzg3YzQ0Y2FkIiwidCI6IjFlZjdkZjkzLWU0YTUtNDA0Ny05MGYwLTdmMGQ5YmM2MzdjMSIsImMiOjh9&pageName=ReportSection).

###More in detail about application,
<br>


<li>**AI-BOT :-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp; I-CARE-YOU Ai Bot schedule medical appointment as per doctor availability and to customer need without reaching service desk and confirmation mail of the appointment sent to mail address 
 &emsp;&emsp;I-CARE-YOU Ai Bot checks Patient Insurance policy number in the data record which is stored in Cosmodb and post validation shares the document for claiming insurance which includes all mandatory like bill invoice upload option and share the document to admin for validation post patient document submission everything carried through automation.

<li>**Data Analytics:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;Big data analytics - Data of the patient unstructured record and insurance claim data analyzed through azure data factory and segregated into a structured data later stored into Azure blob container at the end visualized for better understanding which solves repeated calculation works.

## How we built it

<p>Involves 6 steps:-</p>
Application is built using java,html,css3,and data stored in shared point.

<li>**webview:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp; Built using Html,css3,java,json,bootstrap, hosted in Azure web apps.

<li>**Backend:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;Once the form is submitted data stored in cosmodb,Blob Container with help of powerflow, Powerautomate.

<li>**Powerflow:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;Send email communication appointment booking confirmation and event pass for environment planting.

<li>**PowerBi:-**</li>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Big data analytics - Data of the patient unstructured record and insurance claim data analyzed through azure data factory and segregated into a structured data later stored into Azure blob container at the end visualized for better understanding which solves repeated calculation works.
